# Baba is Translate
 Mess up some language strings and sprites by throwing Baba through Google Translate a bunch of times!

## TODO: 
Read, translate, and build a language file
Translate sprites:
- Grab the word in the sprite from the filename (text_baba\_0\_0.png -> baba)
- Translate it
- Render it by porting the renderer from [RocketRace/robot-is-you](https://github.com/RocketRace/robot-is-you) (using raw render mode)
